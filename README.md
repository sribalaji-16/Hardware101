# Hardware101

Welcome to the Hardware101 Workshop! This workshop will guide you through learning and working on RTL Verilog, and you donâ€™t need any prior experience to get started.

Please make sure to refer to the rules provided and follow the [instructions](Instructions.md) on how to upload your tasks.

Complete the assigned tasks and submit them as you go through the workshop.

# Startup the Essentials (Installation)

In this task, you'll install the Vivado Design Suite. 

For detailed system requirements, installation, and licensing instructions, refer to the [ Installion file](Installation.md)

Why Vivado?

Vivado Design Suite is a powerful tool developed by Xilinx for designing and implementing digital circuits on FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays).
This software is essential for our RTL coding, simulation, and synthesis(we can also use other software such as Intel Quartus Prime,Cadence Genus Synthesis Solution,etc for doing RTL coding simulation and synthesis but here in this workshop we will teach you and provide hands on experience in working with FPGA by using Vivado Design suite)
Here in these tasks you will be learning how to code RTL(Verilog) and Simulation(testing and verifying the behavior of a digital design) and Synthesis(transforming the RTL code into a gate-level representation).

# Task 1

In Task 1, you will learn the basics from [HDL Bits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) and implementing them using Xilinx Vivado.

## Note!
- Don't forget to document your progress by taking screenshots as you work. Upload these screenshots to your given GitHub account. If you need help with this process, please review the [instructions](Instructions.md) again.

- Then initially sign up in [HDL bits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) and maintain the same account so that at last task you will be asked to submit the screenshot of your hdl bits completion status! 

In thiz task 1 you will be working on with the "[Get Started](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Step_one)" and "[Basics](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Wire)" sections and complete them in your HDL bits account(link is directly attached to problem statement) .

Whenever you complete each section your completed section will be marked into green such as this ![IMG-20250219-WA0061 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc9ced2b-8b26-479a-bf0d-eb39fd127439)

- To complete this you should need to know the theory and implementation of it using verilog (where the referal links are attached) so learn [theory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logic-gates/) , then you can learn verilog implementation method to implement in hdl bits by refering these youtube channels "[Why RD?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t27AV5XQrGE&list=PL0E9jhuDlj9qxAfV9hFKNQeHLWimarJJm)" and "[WhiteBrackets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGHlqV2N3bw&list=PLoZS1MH9uqWDYCf6fHLchYS2r1bQFcv3d)"

After that, proceed with the implementation in Xilinx Vivado.

- You can refer this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5YEIFzCOw) to implement in Xilinux vivado.

If you have any doubt feel free to ask that in Whatsapp group.

## NOTE:-
- Submission instructions will be provided shortly please complete the "Startup the Essentials (Installation)" and make sure you go through the ["instructions"](Instructions.md) to know the basics.
- ANY form of plagiarism will not be entertained and you will be disqualified if your repo is found to be plagiarised.
