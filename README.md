# Hardware101

Welcome to the Hardware101 Workshop! This workshop will guide you through learning and working on RTL Verilog, and you donâ€™t need any prior experience to get started.

Please make sure to refer to the rules provided and follow the instructions on how to upload your tasks.

Complete the assigned tasks and submit them as you go through the workshop.

# Startup the Essentials (Installation)

In this task, you'll install the Vivado Design Suite. 

For detailed system requirements, installation, and licensing instructions, refer to the [ Installion file](Installation.md)

Why Vivado?

Vivado Design Suite is a powerful tool developed by Xilinx for designing and implementing digital circuits on FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays).
This software is essential for our RTL coding, simulation, and synthesis(we can also use other software such as Intel Quartus Prime,Cadence Genus Synthesis Solution,etc for doing RTL coding simulation and synthesis but here in this workshop we will teach you and provide hands on experience in working with FPGA by using Vivado Design suite)
Here in these tasks you will be learning how to code RTL(Verilog) and Simulation(testing and verifying the behavior of a digital design) and Synthesis(transforming the RTL code into a gate-level representation).
